## About Me

I’m currently completing my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where I’ll graduate in May. My passion lies at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and solving complex real-world problems. I thrive on continuously learning and experimenting with new AI techniques, striving to stay on the cutting edge of what machine learning can do.

- **Location:** Chicago, IL  
- **Interests:** Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis, MLOps  
- **Achievements & Honors:**  
  - Grainger Innovation Prize Finalist (2024)  
  - Hack Midwest Finalist (2023)  
  - Member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (Computing & Information Honors Society), Phi Theta Kappa, and ACM  
  - Transfer Leadership Scholar and Dean’s List honoree  

During my time at **Siemens**, I tackled real-world challenges in computer vision and data-driven modeling. In my current role as a **Python Developer**, I focus on designing and implementing robust ML pipelines. I’m also proficient in Docker and Kubernetes, enabling seamless deployment and scalability for AI applications.
